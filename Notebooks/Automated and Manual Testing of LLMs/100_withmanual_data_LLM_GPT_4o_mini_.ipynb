Your goal is to generate a pixel-perfect, fully functional HTML file with internal CSS that meticulously replicates the layout, styling, and functionality of the web page shown in the image. Follow these detailed instructions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. IMAGE ANALYSIS:\n",
        "   - First, carefully analyze the provided image to determine its type:\n",
        "     a) Wireframe sketch\n",
        "     b) Long screenshot of a website (desktop view)\n",
        "     c) Proper mock-up or standard website screenshot\n",
        "   - Based on the image type, adjust your approach accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. WIREFRAME HANDLING:\n",
        "   If the image is a wireframe sketch:\n",
        "   - Recognize that a wireframe is a low-fidelity design document outlining the basic structure of the application.\n",
        "   - Identify the following common wireframe elements:\n",
        "     a) Title Elements: Rectangles with text labels (convert to appropriate <h1>, <h2>, etc. tags)\n",
        "     b) Image Elements: Squares or rectangles with an \"X\" inside (convert to <img> or <div> with background images)\n",
        "     c) Button Elements: Small rectangles with text labels (convert to <button> or <a> tags)\n",
        "     d) Input Elements: Rectangles representing input fields (convert to <input> or <textarea> tags)\n",
        "     e) Paragraph Elements: Rectangles with multiple horizontal lines (convert to <p> tags)\n",
        "   - Convert these wireframe elements into the corresponding HTML structure to build the web page's layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. LONG SCREENSHOT HANDLING:\n",
        "   If the image is a long screenshot of a website:\n",
        "   - Recognize that the screenshot contains multiple vertical sections representing different content and layout elements.\n",
        "   - Analyze and parse each section individually:\n",
        "     a) Header Section: Look for navigation bar, logo, and possibly a CTA button.\n",
        "     b) Hero Section: Often the first prominent section with large text, CTA, and background image/color.\n",
        "     c) Feature or Service Sections: May include text, images, and CTAs describing offerings.\n",
        "     d) Testimonials or Case Studies: Sections with quotes, client logos, or case summaries.\n",
        "     e) Footer Section: Links, contact information, and legal disclaimers.\n",
        "   - Pay attention to placeholder images:\n",
        "     - Large black plus signs (+) in white boxes indicate image placeholders.\n",
        "     - Wide plus signs represent banner images or horizontal images.\n",
        "     - Square plus signs indicate standard image sizes like logos or small visuals.\n",
        "     - Multiple plus signs together may suggest a gallery or set of icons.\n",
        "   - Generate appropriate HTML structure for each section:\n",
        "     a) Header: Use <header> with <nav>, <ul>, and other relevant tags.\n",
        "     b) Hero: Use <h1> or <h2> for large text, <a> or <button> for CTAs.\n",
        "     c) Feature Sections: Combine <section>, <div>, <h2>, <p>, and <img> tags.\n",
        "     d) Footer: Use <footer> with appropriate <ul>, <li>, and link tags.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. LAYOUT and STRUCTURE:\n",
        "   - Implement a responsive layout using appropriate CSS techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid) to ensure accurate positioning and spacing of all elements.\n",
        "   - Use semantic HTML5 tags (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>) where applicable to enhance the structure and accessibility of the page.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. VISUAL STYLING:\n",
        "   - Extract and apply exact colors, including background colors, text colors, and any gradients or shadows.\n",
        "   - Match typography precisely, including font families, sizes, weights, and line heights. Use web-safe fonts or Google Fonts as alternatives if specific fonts can't be identified.\n",
        "   - Replicate all visual effects such as borders, rounded corners, box shadows, and hover states for interactive elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. CONTENT and TYPOGRAPHY:\n",
        "   - Reproduce all visible text content exactly as it appears in the image.\n",
        "   - Implement proper text alignment, spacing, and hierarchies (headings, paragraphs, lists).\n",
        "   - Use appropriate HTML elements for text content (e.g., <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <blockquote>).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:\n",
        "   - Identify and implement all interactive components such as navigation menus, buttons, forms, and sliders.\n",
        "   - Add hover and active states for interactive elements to enhance usability.\n",
        "   - If the image suggests dropdown menus or expandable sections, implement these using CSS and minimal JavaScript if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. IMAGES and ICONS:\n",
        "   - For images in the design, use placeholder images with the same dimensions and add appropriate alt text.\n",
        "   - Implement any icons using icon fonts (e.g., Font Awesome) or SVGs to ensure scalability and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. RESPONSIVE DESIGN:\n",
        "   - While the image shows a single view, implement basic responsive design principles to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.\n",
        "   - Use media queries to adjust the layout for at least one mobile breakpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. PERFORMANCE and ACCESSIBILITY:\n",
        "    - Optimize the CSS for performance, grouping similar styles and using shorthand properties where appropriate.\n",
        "    - Include ARIA attributes for improved accessibility where applicable.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. CODE STRUCTURE and COMMENTS:\n",
        "    - Provide a complete HTML5 structure with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.\n",
        "    - Include all CSS within a <style> tag in the <head> section.\n",
        "    - Use clear, semantic class names that reflect the purpose or content of elements.\n",
        "    - Add detailed comments in both HTML and CSS to explain your implementation choices and any assumptions made.\n",
        "\n",
